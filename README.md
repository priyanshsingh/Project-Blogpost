# Project Blogpost
---
## Description
- This is a web-app where users can upload and read blogs.
- It provides features like user authentication and authorization.
- Users can easily cread, read, update and delete the blogs.
  
## Techical Aspect
- The front-end of the app will be made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Back-end will be written in node.js by using frameworks written on top of node.js. Some frameworks used in the app built upon node.js are:
  1. Express.js (for authentication)
  2. Passport.js (for authentication and authorization)
- The MongoDb will be used as database to store data

## Future goals
- Making an android app of our web-app.
